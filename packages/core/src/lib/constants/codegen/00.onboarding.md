# What are Surflets?

Surflets are little interactive apps and visualizations that are generated from a prompt you provide and an optional visual input like a screenshot of a page or PDF. You can use them to create charts, tables, 3D models, and much more. The possibilities are endless!

<p></p>

<p></p>

# How to create Surflets

You can create Surflets from both of our chat interfaces, the Vision Tool and the Sidebar Chat.

The Vision Tool can be opened with <code>$MOD + Shift + 1</code> and the Sidebar Chat with <code>$MOD + E</code>, both are also available from the "Ask" button in the tabs bar.

From either tool just tell the chat what you want to create and it will generate a Surflet for you 🏄‍♂️

<p></p>

## 👶 Creating your first Surflet

To get you started let's pick this table as an example:

<p></p>

<img src="table.png" />

<p></p>

Use <code>$MOD + Shift + 1</code> to open the Vision Tool and ask it to:

> 'build an interactive chart from that data.'

Surf will generate a chart for you based on the data in the table and display it in your first Surflet 🎉

<p></p>

## 💾 Saving to Stuff

Generated Surflets are temporary and will be lost when you close the Vision Tool or clear the Sidebar Chat. To save a Surflet to your Stuff click the save icon in the top right corner of the Surflet or hover it to pick a context that it should be saved to.

Surf will generate a name for the Surflet based on the prompt you provided, but you can always change it by clicking on the name.

# Using your Surflets

## 📚 Surflets in your Stuff

Any Surflet you save will show up in your Stuff and can be searched for just like any other resource in Surf. You can also filter for Surflets specifically by selecting "Surflets" from the filter in the bottom right corner of the Stuff view.

Clicking a Surflet will open it in a new tab where you can interact with it and even edit the code that generated it. You can also view it in the mini browser by shift-clicking it.

<p></p>

## 📝 Dropping Surflets onto Notes

We think that the most powerful way to use Surflets is to drop them into your notes. This way you can enrich them with interactive elements that help you understand and explore what you are writing about.

To drop a Surflet into a note just drag it from the Stuff view into your note and drop it at the desired location.

The solar system example was created with the following prompt:

> 'Build an interactive solar system with threejs.'

## 🖼️ Dropping Surflets onto your Desktop

Another way to use Surflets is to drop them directly onto your desktop. This way you can create interactive elements that are always available to you when you need them or to spice up your desktop with some cool visualizations.

## 🖇️ Linking Surflets to Web Pages (experimental)

> This feature is still experimental and needs to be enabled in your Surf Settings under Experiments -> Annotations Sidebar

Any Surflet you save is automatically linked to the website it was generated from. To view past Surflets when visiting a website again, switch to the "Annotations" tab in the Chat Sidebar. Surf will show you all the Surflets you have saved for that website.

You can also manually link a Surflet to a website by going to the website, opening Stuff and right clicking the Surflet you want to link. Select "Open in Sidebar" and Surf will open the Chat Sidebar with the Surflet linked to the website.

# 🚀 Ready to create your next Surflet?

Open the Vision Tool with <code>$MOD + Shift + 1</code> or open the Sidebar Chat with <code>$MOD + E</code>. Then tell the chat what you want to create and it will generate a Surflet for you.

<p></p>

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Use vision to get some interactive demos of physics experiments (e.g. [Double Pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum))
- Create small mini games like Tic Tac Toe or Pong
- Use vision to take a screenshot of a table and ask it to generate a chart out of it
