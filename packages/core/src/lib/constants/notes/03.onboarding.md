## 1) Find Similar Sources

Sometimes, you know you have the perfect quote, statistic, or reference saved somewhere, but you can't remember where. Surf Notes can help you find these pieces. Simply select any text in your note, and similar content from your saved resources will appear on the right side.

<p></p>

Try it by selecting the following:

<output data-id="similarity-selection">
<i>PLATO was an innovative educational computer system</i>
</output>

<p></p>

<!-- <button data-action="onboarding-select-text" data-icon="cursor-arrow-rays">Select Text</button> -->

<p></p>

## 2) Drag and Drop

You can also drag and drop links, files and more from your stuff into the note to create your own citations. Images will be embedded directly into the note.

<p></p>

Try it by opening the stuff overlay and dragging something into this note.

<p></p>

<button data-action="onboarding-open-stuff">Open Stuff ($MOD + O)</button>
