## Find Similar Sources

Sometimes when you are writing something you know that you have the perfect quote, statistic or reference saved somewhere, but you don‚Äôt quite know where. Smart Notes can help you find those pieces, just select any text in your note and view similar chunks from your stuff on the right side.

<p></p>

Try it by selecting the following:

<output data-id="similarity-selection">
<i>PLATO was an innovative educational computer system</i>
</output>

<p></p>

<!-- <button data-action="onboarding-select-text" data-icon="cursor-arrow-rays">Select Text</button> -->

<p></p>

## Drag and Drop

You can also drag and drop resources from your stuff into the note to create your own citations.

Try it by opening the stuff overlay and dragging a resource into this note.
<button data-action="onboarding-open-stuff">Open Stuff ($MOD + O)</button>

<p></p>

_Note:_ you can also drag and drop images from your stuff into the note.
