Surf‚Äôs Smart Notes can not just help you with writing something new, but it can also improve what you have already written. Select any text in a note and hit the wand icon (ü™Ñ) in the floating menu that pops up.

<p></p>

You can then enter some instructions on how you want Surf to rewrite your selection. This input field supports mentioning other contexts using `@`, just like the note itself. Hit enter or the arrow button and Surf will rewrite your selection with citations to resources it finds in the mentioned contexts.
