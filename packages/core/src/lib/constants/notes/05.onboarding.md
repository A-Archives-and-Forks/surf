title: What can I use it for?

- **🔍 Research:** when researching a topic you usually save a lot of links, documents and pages first and later work on compiling everything into a single document. Smart Notes can do some of the heavy lifting for you by pulling in information, quotes and sources as you write or provide you with inspiration if you get stuck

- **✍️ Note Taking:** when taking notes of a meeting, a class or just throughout the day Smart Notes can help you process and understand what you have written. Ask it questions, summarize it or find related resources that you have already saved in Surf

- **🧠 Brain Storming:** when brainstorming you sometimes need inspiration to get the juices flowing. With Smart Notes you can just ask Surf a question and get back interesting links, videos and more from your own contexts which might just give you the idea you need.
