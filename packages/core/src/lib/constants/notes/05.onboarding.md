- **🔍 Research:** When researching a topic, you often save numerous links, documents, and pages to compile later. Smart Notes can assist by gathering relevant information, quotes, and sources as you write, or by providing inspiration if you get stuck.

- **✍️ Note Taking:** Whether you're jotting down notes from a meeting, a class, or just your daily thoughts, Smart Notes can help you process and understand your entries. You can ask it questions, get summaries, or find related resources that you've already saved in Surf.

- **📚 Writing:** When writing an essay, a blog post, or a report, you can use Smart Notes to find relevant sources, quotes, and references to include in your text. Surf can also help you rewrite your text to improve it or generate suggestions to continue writing.

- **🧠 Brainstorming:** When brainstorming, you might need a spark of inspiration to get your creative juices flowing. Smart Notes can help by allowing you to ask Surf a question and receive interesting links, videos, and more from your own saved contexts, providing the idea you need.
