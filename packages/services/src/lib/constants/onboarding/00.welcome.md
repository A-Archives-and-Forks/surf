## üìñ Notebooks for the Internet

---

Surf is a tool for exploring and creating your personal interests alongside the internet. It enables you to do two things:

- **Collect and organize your favorite bits of the internet** ‚Äî PDFs, YouTube videos, documents, images, and much more ‚Äî into private and personal ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù.

- **Generate editable Notion-style documents** (with AI or manually) from the bits of the internet that are relevant to you, with links pointing back directly to your context.

### üíé How Surf Is Different

---

Surf _is not_ just another browser or chat app. We believe current AI Browsers combine the worst of both worlds. They add a chat onto a browser to automate human consumption.

Surf is designed from the ground-up for **exploration** and **creation**. It‚Äôs not primarily about consuming what others have created, but about helping you create something new.

### üìö Notebooks: Surf‚Äôs Approach to Data

---

Data from across the web (PDFs, YouTube, documents, images, & more) and your own notes can be collected and organized together in one place: a notebook. Anything you add into a notebook is stored on your local machine, creating a local file, database entry, and embedding (for the AI).

This local data can be used to generate new notes, either in combination with other pieces of data, or by it's own. The stored data is private and personal to you, and is never shared with anyone else (but do keep in mind, that the embeddings are read by the AI model of your choice).

### üìù Notes: Creating with Surf

---

Surf notes are rich text documents that are generated or manually created from your personal media. They are similar to Notion pages, but come with some unique features:

- **Context-aware:** Surf notes are aware of the media in your notebook, and can pull-in relevant information and suggestions from your saved stuff. You can `@` mention specific sources in your prompts to fine-tune the context and get more accurate and relevant results.
- **Citations:** when Surf's AI uses your saved media (or sources from the internet), it generates citations that will take you to exact sections of PDFs, timestamps in YouTube videos, portions of websites and so on.
- **Tools:**
  - **Web search** is used to automatically search the web, and brings back summaries of the findings based on the user prompt
  - **Surflets (app generation)** are coded mini-apps that help you understand what you find on the internet, whether it's a table or a graph or a physics concept.

### üë´ How People Are Using Surf

---

People are using Surf to explore and create what‚Äôs meaningful to them. Whether preparing for a job interview, learning how to develop games, or design college majors, we‚Äôve seen people use Surf to best explore their next thought.

**Case Studies:**

- [Organized Care: Reese's Nursing Journey](https://deta.surf/people/reese)
- [From Browser Games to Beats: Efe's Creative Journey](https://deta.surf/people/efe)
- [Public Health Student, Brown University](https://deta.surf/people/2)

### ‚ú® What‚Äôs New in the Beta

---

We‚Äôve redesigned and re-engineered Surf completely since the alpha. We still have a lot of work to do, but the core building blocks are coming in place. _If you have used Surf before, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:_

- **Faster and more reliable:** We‚Äôve completely re-engineered Surf's architecture to be faster and more reliable. The app should feel snappier, and the UI more solid.
- **Simpler and more intuitive:** We removed a lot of the complexity that was in the alpha, and focused on the core use cases.
- **Notebooks instead of Contexts:** We doubled down on Notebooks as a more intuitive and powerful way to organize your data. You can have multiple notebooks, and each notebook can have its own set of resources.

### üöÄ Getting started

---

You are reading a Surf Note right now! As such, you can click anywhere to edit or write something new below, or work with the AI to expand it. The Surf Notes editor supports the Markdown Syntax so you can add headings, lists and _style the text_. You can also type `/` to bring up the command menu to add elements.

Type `@` to mention any media saved in your notebook or tab you have open in Surf. Then ask Surf's AI to help you write, summarize, or brainstorm based on that context.

To get started, try one of these examples:

- `@Demo how to make a game in Unity`
- `@PDF what are the main takeaways from this paper?`
- `Create a interactive visualization of our solar system`

You can also take a look at our full [How to Use Surf]($GETTING_STARTED_LINK) guide for more details.
